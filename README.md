## Introduction
Lunar Front is a small indie multiplayer 2D-shooter. The goal of the player is to destroy as many spaceships of the other team as possible and damage the enemy's planet. 

## Usage
To run a client, simply run the release build on your platform of choice.
If you'd like to run a server, run the same build with the arguments --server and --headless.
If you wish to build your own copy from the source code, you must install Godot (we used V4.3 Mono) and use that to compile the project.
